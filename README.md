# Stock Ticker Project
Hello and welcome to my Stock Ticker Project (Definitely needs a cooler name) 
So far I have: 
- 1️⃣ Leveraged Python and Yahoo Finance to extract stock data for any user-inputted ticker
- 2️⃣ Employed the Pandas library to export and refine the data in a CSV format, eliminating outliers
- 3️⃣ Utilized the Matplotlib library to visualize the CSV data

## Current Visualization

## To Use Currently:
1. Clone the repository
2. Setup a virtual enviornment and install dependencies using: pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Run the main program, in the terminal enter a stock ticker of your choice
4. Enjoy the visualization
